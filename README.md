# Traffic-Sign-Classifier
This project is a traffic sign classification system. It uses a trained deep learning model to identify traffic signs from uploaded images. The project includes a Flask web application to provide an interface for users to upload images and view the classification results.

# Technology Used
Flask: For building the web application due to its simplicity and lightweight nature.

TensorFlow/Keras: To train and load the deep learning model for traffic sign classification.

Pillow: For image preprocessing.

NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn: For data manipulation and visualization during model training.

Werkzeug and Gunicorn: To manage the web server for deployment.
